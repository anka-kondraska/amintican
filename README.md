##Amintican - Newly Minted American Citizens' Site

This site will help newly minted American citizens to familirize themselves with American culture, basic histry, neologisms, sayings and simply things Americans do and like. I will try to capture as many cultural references as I can identify so you dont have to ever feel left out of a conversation or a joke. This is not to suggest that as a newly minted American you would need to abandon what makes you different, to the contrary. Embrace who you are, cherish your unique perspective and be able to participate in conversation without anything holding you back.
